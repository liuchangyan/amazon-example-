## SAP HANA on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start helps you deploy fully functional SAP HANA systems on the AWS Cloud, following best practices from AWS and SAP. 
SAP HANA is an in-memory relational database and application platform that provides high-performance analytics and real-time data 
processing.

AWS provides SAP customers and partners with an SAP-certified cloud infrastructure to run SAP HANA. 
You can deploy SAP HANA on SLES or RHEL.
The Quick Start ensures that Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and the operating system are optimally configured to achieve the 
best performance for your SAP HANA system right out of the box.

The Quick Start offers these deployment options:

- Single-AZ (single-node and multi-node)
- Single-AZ, multi-node, high-availability

The following diagram illustrates the Single-AZ, multi-node option. See the [deployment guide](https://fwd.aws/dvDvB) for descriptions of the other two architectures, as well as best practices, step-by-step instructions, and customization options.
